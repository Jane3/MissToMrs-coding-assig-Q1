# Getting started

This coding assignment contains the general web form that asks the users to type in their "First name", "Last name", "Email", "Password", and "Address". This project is implemented in React.js. 

The "Address" field has autocomplete feature that shows a list of suggestions based on the value the user has inputted. 

You may see a screenshot of the web form by going to the screenshot-demo.png.

# Installation

To run the React.js application, run the following commands:

To install the required module

    npm install

To install the React component enables you to easily build a customized autocomplete dropdown powered by Google Maps Places Library

    npm install --save react-places-autocomplete

To use the react-places-autocomplete component, you are going to need to load Google Maps JavaScript API. To load the library in the project, use the following code and put it into public/index.html.

    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>

To get your API key, please refer to the following documentation:

To run the project, use the following command: 

    npm start
